[can't save the servo position's param](http://diydrones.com/forum/topics/apm-can-t-save-the-servo-position-s-param-what-can-i-do-for-it?xg_source=activity)
Until now APM can't save it.<br>
I try to modify code, and <a href='http://diydrones.com/forum/topics/pls-help-how-to-change-behavior-of-servo-to-like-this'>the developer of APM gave me some help</a>. Unfortunately I failed. My knowledge of program isn't enough to control APM's large codes.
