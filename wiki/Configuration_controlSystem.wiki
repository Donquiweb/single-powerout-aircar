==Setup by MWC==
The concept model fly with multiwii, The mode is helicopter ccpm 120. Finish setup by [http://fotoflygarn.blogspot.com/2012/04/multiwii-helicopter.html MWC Heli manual].
===notice!!!===
channel 1, you need set to fix value such as 1500, it's not throttle!, your must control throttle by other channel, for example ESC(THR) connect to channel 5.<br>
Then we need change servo behavior:
[http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/control-2.jpg]
Open config.h
Find:<code>
#define SERVO_ENDPOINT_LOW {1020,1020,1020,1020,1020,1020,1020,1020};
</code>
change to 
'
#define SERVO_ENDPOINT_LOW {1350,1020,1020,1510,1510,1020,1510,1020};
'
The value about is 1500, it's the center point for servo. It will limit route of servo become half.<br>
Find:#define SERVO_NICK   { +10, -18, -0 }
    #define SERVO_LEFT   { +10, +9, -18 }
    #define SERVO_RIGHT  { +10, +9, +18 }
