## What's this? ##
The SPOFC(SinglePowerOutFlyingCar) is a open source project aiming to prove a **practical** **ducted** **fan** **VTOL** flying car, it can be built of **Multicopter technology** and **gas engine** or fanjet.<br>

<h2>The concept</h2>
The air has one way in to three way out. Every gas outlet need control flow rate, so there is a 3 point made different force, it can control the flying car movement. One outlet of three can rotate, it can control the flying car's direction.<br>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul><li>Fit all kind of engine, electric, piston and turbine;<br>
</li><li>Get out cool air. Doesn't burn grass and is not harmful to people on the ground.<br>
</li><li>Can be built it for 2-seater or 4-seater capacity or even bigger;<br>
</li><li>ore safe and durable because all rotating parts are inside the frames. It's easy to add protection features than traditional helicopter, probably can be real flying tank in war or counter-terrorist defense.<br>
</li><li>Easy to build. It isn't dependent on any new technology in fact it is a combination of old technology.<br>
</li><li>The Mechanical complexity is lower than traditional helicopter;<br>
</li><li>Efficiency and flying range probably is much lower than traditional helicopter.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Speed: The helicopter is faster others.<br>
</li><li>Range:The multi-copter is battery operated. SPOFC is good enough for going back and forth from home to office or vice versa.<br>
</li><li>Smaller size the same as a car,  meaning the aircraft can easily be parked.<br>
</li><li>Safety in dowtown: If you find a helicopter fly through in downtown, you must be said, this is a brave man. If you find a plane fly through in downtown, you must be said, this is a madman. If you find a SOPflyingcar or multicopter fly through in downtown, don't be surprise, everyone can do it, cause all the rotation part was packaged under shell, it's very safety.<br>
</li><li>Safe in downtown area: If you find a helicopter fly in downtown, you can say – “this is a brave man”. If you find a plane fly downtown, you can say – “this is a madman”. If you find a SOP flying car or multi-copter fly through in downtown, don't be surprise - everyone can do it.<br>
</li><li>Easy to repair: The Mechanical complexity of helicopter is big. There are less moving parts of multi-copter.<br>
</li><li>Easy to drive: SPOFC and multi-copter can easily be control just like the car, even more easy If the battery can work for a long time, the multi-copter can be a perfect flying car. Unlike Other idea of making gas engine multi-copter, but the Mechanical complexity is more than helicopter. SPOFC needs only extra large battery.</li></ul>

<h3>Why am i doing this?</h3>
I am a guy living in a country where there are too much pirated software and copyright issue is too bad. I used many pirated software when I was a kid. But I known CC and opensource at now. Many great people make opensource software and hardware or other project without reward. They share and develop knowledge to make It more useful and a big help for whole world . I had done some wrong things in the past, But now, i hope to do some right things. I want share my idea to the world.I want a flying car to be realistic. To Fly easier than traditional car and helicopter, I guess the multi-copter was  powerful and stable enough. There was a manned multicopter built tested successfully in Germany but flying time is too short, because it use electric system. The gas engine was old and steady too. If we consider  multi-copter + gas engine, we will get a flying car. But gas engine can't fast change throttle like electric motor do. So we need to fix this multi-copter system for gas engine<br>
If we want to built a practical flying car. It must have one or a group gas engine, single throttle control and changes its speed not too fast. I would appreciate If  you want to feed in more idea to help me with my proposal.<br>
