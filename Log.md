Testing fly of No.7 was finish. It's not bad.

http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/no7-1.JPG

But the motor got a big smoke and scraped. It's my fault, the motor([XM3548CA-5](http://www.dualsky.com/pro_list_for.asp?sid=119&Keywords=3548CA-5&id=296)) max use by 4s LiPo. I always use by 6s LiPo.
And my 6s cell was scraped too, I have no idea for this.

No.6 can't rise up. I guess thrust was limited cause the gas exit was too small.

#### 2013.3.1 ####
No.6 was almost ready.

Found a gift from Fredo6.
[Curviloft](http://sketchucation.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=28586) is a great plugin of shetchup. Now, i probaby make my monstor to looks more good.

#### 2013.2.14 ####
Drawing of no.6 was finish

I known what it can't rise up by a test.

ducted fan max throttle with my frame

![http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/no_4_4.jpg](http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/no_4_4.jpg)

Just 332g...

ducted fan max throttle without my frame

![http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/no_4_5.jpg](http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/no_4_5.jpg)

1079g! Ok, Air proof of my frame must was too bad!



#### 2013.1.30 ####
Bad day again. I try a test flying, but it can't rise up...

![http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/no_4_3.jpg](http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/no_4_3.jpg)

It's 683g now, The max thrust of ducted fan is 1.36KG!!! I have on idea... Are they kidding me? Maybe ducted fan was liar...




#### 2013.1.27 ####
Little monster begin to make...
![http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/no_4_1.jpg](http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/no_4_1.jpg)

Now, 23:00

![http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/no_4_2.jpg](http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/no_4_2.jpg)

The frames was finish. Mount electric device tomorrow.

#### 2013.1.17 ####
Got the new ducted fan.

http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/turning-5.JPG

Begin smaller monster design...

#### 2013.1.13 ####
Today is my birthday, but No.3 isn't a good gift for me.

<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=vgBjYFmJj_c' target='_blank'><img src='http://img.youtube.com/vi/vgBjYFmJj_c/0.jpg' width='425' height=344 /></a>

It's real too heavy...

Next video is dead of No.3, unfortunate my wife forgot press down record button. so just show pictures.

http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/no_3_dead_3.JPG

I will try smaller and lighter model.


#### 2013.1.12 ####
My monster No.3 was completed.
http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/frames-11.JPG
Now��?it's enough big.
http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/frames-12.JPG
But it's too heavy. Rise up when throttle's position over 3/4. its first flying was very poor...Keep go on in tomorrow.

#### 2012.12.18 ####
My monster No.2 finished his life...

I guess the force moment was too short,so it's too difficult to control.

![http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/fm-1.jpg](http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/fm-1.jpg)

Next monster will make more big.

Today have a bad news, My study visa was refused by china canada embassy. //(ㄒo��?////(ㄒo��?////(ㄒo��?//

#### 2012.12.17 ####
Keep testing my monster.

<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=JF5fvdasLsI' target='_blank'><img src='http://img.youtube.com/vi/JF5fvdasLsI/0.jpg' width='425' height=344 /></a>

Looks it was better. Don't always rotation.

#### 2012.12.16. ####
Try many times to fly, but it's more bad than first flying.(ㄒo��? I don't know where wrong...Don't give up, continue try it.

#### 2012.12.9. ####
I make a new MWC used arduino pro mini+mpu6050.

![http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/turning-4.jpg](http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/turning-4.jpg)
![http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/turning-3.jpg](http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/turning-3.jpg)

Try a fly my monster. The reactive force still was too strong, it always rotate. Looks i must fix frames.

### 2012.12.8. ###
My monster's first flight.

<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=C7HJghHp6B4' target='_blank'><img src='http://img.youtube.com/vi/C7HJghHp6B4/0.jpg' width='425' height=344 /></a> MWC2.1 heli-120-ccpm

Always rotation, the tail looks not useful. I guess the propeller's reactive force is too big and tail blade is too small, it's not enough hold orientation. Stabilize is not good too. //(ㄒo��?//

I tried traditional helicopter CCPM system at night.![http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/turning-2.jpg](http://single-powerout-aircar.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pic/turning-2.jpg)
It's too fast roll, can't be control. Crazy more than used MWC. The stabilize is useful but it work was not very good. Keep try turning by MWC, probably it can be stabilized finally.

#### 2012.12.7. ####
Turning was too difficult beyond my imagination. CCPM is a very easy to chaos and servos mount was a disaster. I had no time to fly in today.

#### 2012.12.6. ####
Got new frames. It's better except i had two small mistakes. lucky is the mistakes not enough block this process. Finally I can test flight my monster in tomorrow.

#### 2012.12.4. ####
Third drawing fix and send to laser cnc. I got a great gift. The google sketchup is free CAD software. It's a wonderful meaning for me! because I from a country of always used pirate software. Thanks google and [dxf\_plup-in](http://www.guitar-list.com/download-software/convert-sketchup-skp-files-dxf-or-stl) to help me export DXF, then i can finish this project and don't use pirate software. Hope it can save my soul a little.

### 2012.11.27. ###
The accident always full in the life. I plan use [APM](http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/) to control this monster. [APM](http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/) is a system of very powerful and easy to use, but his helicopter mode(ver. 2.7.3) had a few bug, tail can't control by joystick and [can't save the servo position's param](http://diydrones.com/forum/topics/apm-can-t-save-the-servo-position-s-param-what-can-i-do-for-it?xg_source=activity). Now [MWC](http://code.google.com/p/multiwii/) give me a big surprise, He can support [helicopter mode](http://fotoflygarn.blogspot.com/2012/04/multiwii-helicopter.html) too. Although [MWC](http://code.google.com/p/multiwii/) haven't too much function like [APM](http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/), but basic helicopter flying control looks better than [APM](http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/). It's just guess, need wait real flight testing.

So sad a day��?I got second frames after long time waiting. First cnc operator had mistake, lost some detail, and i had mistake again. So drawing must fix again. Just a good news, the test of electronic part was successful. Four servos use 6v 8a power, BEC and APM use 5v 2a power. They can work together.

#### 2012.11.22. ####
Got new servo and send drawing to laser cnc.

#### 2012.11.18. ####
I got great confidence from the monster rise up. I decide use better servo. Today, finished fix door and tooth size, re-design servo seat.

#### 2012.11.16. ####
got the frames and first build. The doors size all was wrong!!!FML! Need fix it and laser cnc again... lucky have a good thing, thrust was enough, this heavy monster really can be fly. It can rise when throttle position at 55%.

#### 2012.11.14. ####
send drawing to laser cnc, use 2mm composite laminate.<br />
2012.11.13.
finish drawing design.
